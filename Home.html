<h3 class="top">Junior Double Major in Physics and Computer Science at Union College<br>Minor in Astrophysics and Music</h3>

  <p>
Ingenious and detail-oriented undergraduate student with a strong academic foundation in astrophysics, physics, and computer science. I am passionate about learning new things in astrophysics and eager to explore new and exciting research in the field.
  </p>
  <p>
I am skilled in data analysis and computer programming (Python, Java, Mathematica) with experience in astrophysics research. I am currently working as a research assistant to John Rieffel of the computer science department working on 2D simulations along with continuing my research of studying the decay of neutral kaons with Colin Gleason of the physics department.
  </p>
  <p>
Currently, I am eager to expand my knowledge and experience in astrophysics. I am open to opportunities that will allow me to learn new skills and explore things I am passionate about. I plan to focus on higher education after graduation, and I hope to pursue a career in academia or research in the future.
