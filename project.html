      The standard cosmological model of the universe is that of flat space with cold dark matter and cosmological constant denoted as Λ (Flat-ΛCDM model). Possible extensions in the model include a non-constant equation of state parameter for dark energy (Flat-wCDM model) or time-varying dark energy modelled by a linear parametrization, where w=w0+wa(1-a) (Flat-w0waCDM model). For the final project in Computational Physics, we used Type Ia supernova data from the Supernova Cosmology Project to find the best fit values for dark energy parameters using weighted χ2 fitting. Our results indicate that Flat-wCDM was the best fit model with a non-constant density of dark energy.

      We used type Ia supernova data to model the equation of state for dark energy and determine whether the cosmological constant is the best fit. Our findings yielded a value of Ω<sub>DE</sub> = 0.90<sup>+0.10</sup>  <sub>−0.38</sub> and wDE = −0.60<sup>+0.29</sup><sub>−0.27</sub>, where Ω<sub>DE</sub> is the density parameter for dark energy and w<sub>DE</sub> is its equation of state parameter, which is the ratio of the pressure to energy density of dark energy. Our findings conflict with the equation of state of the cosmological constant, w<sub>Λ</sub> = −1, suggesting that the density of dark energy may vary with time

    <h2>Analysis of Lead Contamination in Soil Samples from Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge</h2>

      Pollution in all forms is hazardous to the environment and human health, especially so for lead pollution. The goal of the research is to use the ion beam analysis technique of Proton-Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) spectroscopy to analyze the chemical composition of soil samples in key locations near Ed Koch Queensboro bridge (Figure 1). Our research focuses specifically on the concentration of lead in these soil samples due to the use of lead-based paint to paint bridges built in the early 1900’s. Subsequent maintenance to these bridges included sandblasting and repainting with a non-lead based paint. It is believed that significant traces of lead will still present in the soil around these bridges due to the lack of containment of lead dust from sandblasting.

      Here, we report time-series data for a Jupiter trojan, (884) Priamus in the Trojan camp at the L5 Lagrangian point. Priamus was observed the Union College Observatory as well as remote observatories operated by Telescope.Live and iTelescope.net on four nights. Lightcurves were constructed using standard corrections for light-travel time, unit distances and solar phase angle correction. We fit a synodic spin period of  6.8607 ± 0.0004 h and amplitude of 0.23 ± 0.03 mag, which can help determine the vector spin in combination with observations from other apparitions. Our research will contribute to the study of the YORP effect whereby the interaction of solar radiation can change the rotation rate and spin axis of the asteroid.

      Observations of the main belt asteroid and Koronis family member (1497) Tampere were undertaken to determine the rotation period and facilitate future studies of the YORP effect. Here, we report rotational lightcurves for the asteroid. Our data were included in a larger study [1] which inferred rotation period 3.30237 ± 0.00015, assuming a doubly-periodic lightcurve.
